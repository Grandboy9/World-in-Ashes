  persiaft.0.t:0 "The Kurdish Threat"
  persiaft.0.d:0 "For centuries, the eastern Kurds have been under the foot of Persia. It is, only now, they cite their want for independence, at such an unstable time in Iranian history. While the changing of the name of Persia to Iran has helped cool tensions in the region, it is uncertain whether the Iranian Kurds will rise up again, like they did on Sept. 16th, 1933. This revolt was squashed on Oct. 14th of the same year, but we cannot risk another revolt.\n\nWhat shall we do with these dissenters?"
