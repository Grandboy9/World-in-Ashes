   modusa.0.t:0 "Riots in Chicago"
   modusa.0.d:0 "Earlier this morning, protesters gathered outside Chicago City Hall to protest the election results. Out of a city of over two million, 300,000 people came marching out onto the streets in the largest protest to date. The protest, organized by the leader of the Socialist Party, Norman Thomas, started in the outer rim of the city and gradually marched inwards. After delivering a passionate speech about the fight for America at City Hall, Norman Thomas advocated for the use of violence against the 'Capitalist Empire of America,' causing many problems with rioters.\n\nUsually, in protests, there are riotors. Rioters are often not a problem, as they are a small minority of the whole, and can be dealt with by police, however, the amount of rioters was unusually large, with even entire blocks being riddled with windows and doors broken. These areas are anti-socialist strongholds, so many believe these are politically-motivated attacks, supported by Norman Thomas. Already, over 20 cuplrits have been arrested, and many are calling for the arrest of Norman Thomas himself, though that is a legal impossiblity since Norman Thomas never has commited a crime.\n\nThe local police seem incapable of handling the situation, as many have defected over to the side of the protesters and rioters, outright defending their devious activities. Any action taken will result in injuries, but we have little choice but to take action, and send in the National Guard to restore order."
   modusa.0.a:0 "Send in the National Guard!"
   modusa.1.t:0 "The Chicago Massacre"
   modusa.1.d:0 "Two days ago, protesters gathered at Chicago City Hall to protest the election. The protest was filled with riots, so we dispatched the National Guard to deal with them. This has turned out to be a fatal error in judgement.\n\nJust before noon, today, rioters attacked the National Guard in an attempt to storm them out of the city. The National Guard fought back, firing on the rioters amd protestors, killing 43 and wounding 115. These attacks happened in multiple areas at the same time, leading investigators to suspect it was a coordinated attack.\n\nSocialist Party USA leader Norman Thomas has declared this incident the 'Chicago Massacre.' This has swayed many over to the socialist side, and convinced others that the Federal Government may need to be overthrown, instead of just reformed, into a socialist state.\n\nThe situation is now utterly precarious, as both sides now begin to arm themselves. The Second American Civil War may now erupt again."
   modusa.1.a:0 "We have made a fatal mistake..."
   modusa.2.t:0 "Widespread Protests in the North"
   modusa.2.d:0 "After the Chicago Massacre, radical socialists have taken to the streets in protest, with rioters amongst them. Their numbers are large, and unstoppable, and they are causing countless economic damage to the North and Midwest. This must be stopped."
   modusa.2.a:0 "It's getting worse."

  socialist_tensions_desc:0 "Socialism has been growing in the United States ever since the beginning of this century. It only started becoming hugely popular in the roaring 20's. After the New York Stock Exchange crash of 1933, socialism started soaring in popularity, especially the Steel Belt and Northeast where unemployment was at its highest.\n\nSocialists and Communists now openly fight on the streets with Republicans and Democrats. Democrats, however, seized on this opportunity and are now sporting much more social policies. Republicans remain entrenched in their capitalist values. With North and South once again divided, it seems that Civil War is, once again, inevitable."
