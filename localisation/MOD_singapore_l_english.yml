   singapore.1.title:0 "Anti-German Rally"
   singapore.1.desc:0 "Today a mixture of various natives marched throughout Singapore in protest of German rule. While being peaceful throughout, many Germans immediately fled into their homes out of fear. The protest started at approximately 8:30am, at first only hosting a handful of participants. However, it quickly grew, and by 10:00am it hosted 20,000 people and by 1:00pm gathered 50,000 people. They protested no specific aspect of German rule, however it showed the populaces hope for home rule. During the course of the protest no one was harmed and no private property was damaged."
   singapore.1.a:0 "If this is to continue, worse is to come."
   singapore.2.title:0 "Rallies Continue"
   singapore.2.desc:0 "Over the past couple of days the rallies have continued, with them attracting even more members. While retaining the peaceful aspect, many German citizens are worried and are seeking actions taken against the rallies. Albert Hahl, the Colonial Governor, is also seeking action taken against the protesters, however due to being away from Singapore he can't address it himself and the council is unable to address the issue due to being preoccupied with other matters. Both the Germans and Albert Hahl expect the rallies to turn violent before any action can be taken against them, however only time will tell if they are correct."
   singapore.2.a:0 "Hopefully they are wrong, for this nation can not take violence."
