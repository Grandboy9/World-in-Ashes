  singapore.0.title:0 "Singapore In Recent History"
  singapore.0.desc:0 "   For much of the remembered history of Singapore, the nation has been under the guidance of the United Kingdom. However, as the United Kingdom fractured, and Siam began to look south to our great city, a treaty was signed in 1929. It was a deal between the United Kingdom and the German Empire, and within it declared the immediate transfer of the city of Singapore, and surrounding territories, to the German Empire, declaring the start of [SIN.GetNameDef]. \n   The treaty also defined the nature of the state, with it directly ruled by a Colonial Governor with absolute power. Chosen as the governor, was Albert Hahl, the previous governor of German New Guinea. However, due to his pro-German and anti-Native stance, he was quickly despised by many of the locals. Below the Colonial Governor is the Council of Representation. While it traditionally holds no power, it becomes the single ruling force when the Colonial Governor is deemed as unable to rule, either due to sickness, being away, or another reason, by the Kaiser. They also achieve power whenever the Colonial Governor dies, as the Kaiser will send a list of three candidates which the council chooses from. The council is elected for life by the local populace. \n   Since the German acquisition of Singapore, tensions have been on the rise. Funding for schools have plummeted, meaning that while the working class at the time was not affected, as the new generation moves into various jobs, our nation is feeling the consequences. In addition to this, the military has been ignored, meaning if riots were to turn violent, there wouldn't be much we could do. Even our industry is failing, with uneducated civilians moving into the jobs and factories closing frequently. Beyond all of that, our nation is fractured. The cultural divide within our city has been growing over the past couple of years, and it is at an all time high. And with Albert Hahl temporarily away on a trip to visit the Kaiser, the hatred has further grown. \n   Fate has not been kind to our city, however a turning point is upon us, so we must guide our nation back to safe waters."

  #Early Rebels
   singapore.1.title:0 "Anti-German Rally"
   singapore.1.desc:0 "   Today a march was organized by various groups native to Singapore. The rally consisted of various views, with the most prevalent of all being an anti-German sentiment, however the rally also sported hatred against German rule, support for home rule, and support for militarization of the nation. Some groups also supported being returned to the English, being under Siam, or fleeing to America among other drastic solutions. Many Germans were worried the rally would turn violent due to its subject matter, and as such locked themselves inside of homes or stores, however the rally itself never brought any harm or damage. In addition to this many German businesses were closed for the day leading to a small decline in the economy. \n   The reports of the rally itself are varied, often times being biased. Even the more credible sources are inconsistent, with estimations varying anywhere from a membership of 10,000 to 50,000. None the less, all reports agree it is a large shift within the recent history of [SIN.GetNameDef]. Beyond that some sources say major threats were made both against the government and German citizens, however the validity of these claims are doubted due to their biased nature. Despite this, many newspapers are using this as a chance to prove a point, often times stating their distaste with the \"German Oppressors\" or the \"Rebellious Natives\", however as with before these often come from biased sources. \n   No matter what the press has to say, as the news reaches the Kaiser back in the mainland, all of us must brace for the revolution to come."
   singapore.1.a:0 "If this is to continue, worse is to come."

   singapore.2.title:0 "Rallies Continue"
   singapore.2.desc:0 "   Over the past couple of days the rallies have continued. As time passes more groups and individuals join the protests again German rule, however their subject matter also continues to broaden. Despite this, their main goal continues to remain the same, gain independence from Germany. Some blame this major shift on Albert Hahl, being an unpopular governor since his rise to power, however others believe the roots of the issue go much deeper, however their opinions on where the find these roots often vary. In addition to this, no solution has been proposed by any member of government both due to them being occupied, but also due the complicated nature of the rallies. \n   Throughout the course of the rallies, none turned violent. However, this did not stop it from harming our nation. Out of fear of violence breaking out, many Germans closed their shops, didn't show up to their jobs, or locked themselves inside of their homes. This has had not just an obvious impact on the economy, but also the reach of the government over [SIN.GetNameDef]. This has also begin to worry those back in mainland Germany, as the Kaiser's grasp over the city continues to wane. Only time will tell if the Kaiser was right to worry. \n   In addition to this, many watchers of the protests and news outlets believe the peaceful nature of the rallies is nearly over. As aggressive chants and threats become more common, it seems we have bought ourselves a one way ticket to Hell."
   singapore.2.a:0 "Hopefully they are wrong, for this nation can not take violence."

   singapore.3.title:0 "Albert Hahl Returns"
   singapore.3.desc:0 "Albert Hahl has recently returned back to Singapore from his trip to mainland Germany. In doing so the council has now lost its executive power, leaving him as the singular power once more. This also means reactions to the rallies may be more direct and come sooner, however that is too be seen. As his plane landed many Germans were seen cheering, while many natives were seen protesting his rule."
   singapore.3.a:0 "The divide seems to be growing within the populace."
   singapore.3.a.tooltip:0 "§HAlbert Hahl becomes leader of [SIN.GetNameDef]§! \n §HMinor increase in support of Fascism§! \n §RMinor decrease in immediate political power§! \n §RMinor decrease in national stability§!"
   singapore.4.title:0 "Rallies Turn Violent"
   singapore.4.desc:0 "Only a couple of days after Albert Hahl returned, the protesters showed their true colors. Marching through Singapore, some began to light fires and burn the flag of German Sincapur. In the great display multiple pictures of Albert Hahl were burned with multiple Germans being attacked. While some were heavily injured, none were killed in the protests. During the protests many also threatened to burn down the homes of various Germans, however, at least as of now, these threats have not been backed with action. As Singapore begins to burn under the wrath of many, the government can no longer stand idle."
   singapore.4.a:0 "We must seek peaceful resolution to the madness."
   singapore.4.b:0 "To make peace with the mad we must declare a war."
   singapore.5.title:0 "Peaceful Opposition to the Rallies"
   singapore.5.desc:0 "It has been chosen to take peaceful action against the protesters, however multiple paths beyond that have been proposed. The least popular of them is to wait it out, those who back this option believe that allowing aggressive rallies to continue shall allow the will of the people to be instated, while its critics believe it will lead to death. A more popular option is to introduce counter-propaganda as a way to convince the protesters to turn away from violence or their political beliefs. While some believe it is the best option, it will be costly to conduct. The final option, and the most popular, is to imprison the heads of the protests. This would lead to the organizers no longer being able to conduct rallies, which many say will deter the rest."
   singapore.5.a:0 "We should wait it out to allow the populace to decide."
   singapore.5.b:0 "Our goal should be to win over the people, we should begin propaganda."
   singapore.5.c:0 "If we cut off the head the body can not live."
   singapore.6.title:0 "Vigilantes Rise"
   singapore.6.desc:0 "Due to our passive approach to the rallies, vigilantes have risen. While many are Germans seeking "justice" against the protesters, others are natives believing the protesters to be taking a simple issue too far. While no casualties have resulted of this, some have been maimed for life leading some to believe their intention may not have been mercy. This also leads to many worrying that the protesters will react in an equally violent fashion. So far, we have three main proposals to solve this. The first is to continue our previous policy and to wait it out, hoping they will resolve it themselves. The second is to support the vigilantes indirectly, by providing weaponry and similar equipment. Finally, the third, is to fight back against them in the hopes of bringing peace once more."
   singapore.6.a:0 "We must continue to passively observe."
   singapore.6.b:0 "The vigilantes are right, as such we must support their cause."
   singapore.6.c:0 "It is our job to protect the people, we must fight back."

 #National Leaders
  politics_council_of_representation_desc:0 "Established as per the treaty which transfered ownership of Singapore to the German Empire, it is made up of a series of elected officials. They are elected for life directly by the general populace, however with some limitations, the most notable of which is that those of German heritage may not vote. This was created in an attempt to quell the native populace which many believe would resent German rule. The Council of Representation rarely holds any power, instead being a figurehead with little control, however they gain power upon the Colonial Governor being declared unfit to rule by the Kaiser."
  politics_albert_hahl_desc:0 "Born in 1868, Albert Hahl was previously the Governor of German New Guinea, however after the Great War was removed from the position. Upon Singapore being controlled by Germany, he was reinstated as a Colonial Governor, however this time over German Sincapur instead of German New Guinea. He is both the first, and so far only, Colonial Governor of German Sincapur, however he is also disliked by the populace. Due to a strong pro-German and anti-Native stance, he has become an extremely unpopular Colonial Governor, however he still holds onto his position hoping he can help the nation."
