   singapore.1.title:0 "Anti-German Rally"
   singapore.1.desc:0 "Today a mixture of various natives marched throughout Singapore in protest of German rule. While being peaceful throughout, many Germans immediately fled into their homes out of fear. The protest started at approximately 8:30am, at first only hosting a handful of participants. However, it quickly grew, and by 10:00am it hosted 20,000 people and by 1:00pm gathered 50,000 people. They protested no specific aspect of German rule, however it showed the populaces hope for home rule. During the course of the protest no one was harmed and no private property was damaged."
   singapore.1.a:0 "If this is to continue, worse is to come."
   singapore.2.title:0 "Rallies Continue"
   singapore.2.desc:0 "Over the past couple of days the rallies have continued, with them attracting even more members. While retaining the peaceful aspect, many German citizens are worried and are seeking actions taken against the rallies. Albert Hahl, the Colonial Governor, is also seeking action taken against the protesters, however due to being away from Singapore he can't address it himself and the council is unable to address the issue due to being preoccupied with other matters. Both the Germans and Albert Hahl expect the rallies to turn violent before any action can be taken against them, however only time will tell if they are correct."
   singapore.2.a:0 "Hopefully they are wrong, for this nation can not take violence."
   singapore.3.title:0 "Albert Hahl Returns"
   singapore.3.desc:0 "Albert Hahl has recently returned back to Singapore from his trip to mainland Germany. In doing so the council has now lost its executive power, leaving him as the singular power once more. This also means reactions to the rallies may be more direct and come sooner, however that is too be seen. As his plane landed many Germans were seen cheering, while many natives were seen protesting his rule."
   singapore.3.a:0 "The divide seems to be growing within the populace."
   singapore.4.title:0 "Rallies Turn Violent"
   singapore.4.desc:0 "Only a couple of days after Albert Hahl returned, the protesters showed their true colors. Marching through Singapore, some began to light fires and burn the flag of German Sincapur. In the great display multiple pictures of Albert Hahl were burned with multiple Germans being attacked. While some were heavily injured, none were killed in the protests. During the protests many also threatened to burn down the homes of various Germans, however, at least as of now, these threats have not been backed with action. As Singapore begins to burn under the wrath of many, the government can no longer stand idle."
   singapore.4.a:0 "We must seek peaceful resolution to the madness."
   singapore.4.b:0 "To make peace with the mad we must declare a war."
   singapore.5.title:0 "Peaceful Opposition to the Rallies"
   singapore.5.desc:0 "It has been chosen to take peaceful action against the protesters, however multiple paths beyond that have been proposed. The least popular of them is to wait it out, those who back this option believe that allowing aggressive rallies to continue shall allow the will of the people to be instated, while its critics believe it will lead to death. A more popular option is to introduce counter-propaganda as a way to convince the protesters to turn away from violence or their political beliefs. While some believe it is the best option, it will be costly to conduct. The final option, and the most popular, is to imprison the heads of the protests. This would lead to the organizers no longer being able to conduct rallies, which many say will deter the rest."
   singapore.5.a:0 "We should wait it out to allow the populace to decide."
   singapore.5.b:0 "Our goal should be to win over the people, we should begin propaganda."
   singapore.5.c:0 "If we cut off the head the body can not live."
   singapore.6.title:0 "Vigilantes Rise"
   singapore.6.desc:0 "Due to our passive approach to the rallies, vigilantes have risen. While many are Germans seeking "justice" against the protesters, others are natives believing the protesters to be taking a simple issue too far. While no casualties have resulted of this, some have been maimed for life leading some to believe their intention may not have been mercy. This also leads to many worrying that the protesters will react in an equally violent fashion. So far, we have three main proposals to solve this. The first is to continue our previous policy and to wait it out, hoping they will resolve it themselves. The second is to support the vigilantes indirectly, by providing weaponry and similar equipment. Finally, the third, is to fight back against them in the hopes of bringing peace once more."
   singapore.6.a:0 "We must continue to passively observe."
   singapore.6.b:0 "The vigilantes are right, as such we must support their cause."
   singapore.6.c:0 "It is our job to protect the people, we must fight back."
